        # ROLES OF VARIABLES AND DATA TYPES IN PROGRAMMING AND HOW THEY ARE USED TO STORE AND MANIPULATE DATA
    # Variables
# -Variables are storage containers that hold data.Variables are names that represent memory locations/ addresses where data is stored.
#   The data they hold can change during the execution of a program.
# -The value of a variable is the content of the content of the memory cell associated with the variable.
# -A variable also has a type which specifies the range of actions that can be performed on the variable. It also specifies the legal range of values the variable can hold.
# -Variables are crucial for storing and managing data in a program, making it easier to work with information.
# -Variables allow programmers to store data, such as numbers, text, or complex structures in memory.This data can be inputs, intermediate results or outputs of a program.
# -Variables are dynamic meaning the data they hold can change. This property is important for processing and updating information as a program runs.
# -Variables provide descriptive names for data, improving code readability and making It easier for programmers to understand the purpose of each data item.

    # Data Types
# -A data type defines a collection of data objects and a set of predefined operations on those objects
# -Data types specify the kind of data that can be stored in variables.
# -Common data  types include integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more specialized types like arrays and objects.

# -Type safety: Data types enforce rules about what operations can be performed on a variable.
#               For example, adding two integers differs from adding two strings, and data types prevent incompatible operations
# -Data validation: Data types help validate and protect integrity of data.
#                   They ensure that variables contain only valid and expected values.
# -Memory allocation: Different data types require different amounts of memory.
#                     For efficiency and correctness, it is crucial to allocate the right amount of memory for each variable
# -Operations: Data types define the operations that can be performed on data, such as arithmetic operations for
#              numbers or string concatenation for text


#           CONCLUSION
# To summarise, variables and data types are foundational concepts in programming.
# They provide the means to store, manage and manipulate data, which is at the core of most software applications.
# Proper use of variables and data types ensures data integrity, program correctness, and code readability, making them
# indespensable tools for programmers as they design, build and maintain software systems.
